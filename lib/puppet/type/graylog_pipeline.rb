    @summary
      Creates a processing pipleine.

    Creates a processing pipeline. This type takes the pipeline definition as
    source text; note that the pipeline name in the source text must match the
    resource title. Overall, you may find it more convenient to use the
    graylog_api::pipeline defined type, which can take care of this for you, as
    well as accepting e.g. an array of rules to apply rather than source text.

    @see graylog_api::pipeline

    @example
      graylog_pipeline { 'example pipeline':
        description       => 'An example processing pipleine',
        source            => @(END_OF_PIPELINE),
                            pipeline "everity"
                            stage 3 match either
                              rule "foo";
                              rule "bar";
                            stage 5 match all
                              rule "baz";
